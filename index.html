		<h1>Karawhiua Mai</h1>
		<p>	A growing yearning minimalist take on the world. Tough and Fierce to the Challenge and Thrill of Adventure. Blood & Fire.<br> 
		Learned Inspiration from standing on the shoulders of friendly blue giants. Ego Zero Sum.<br> 
		Sharing brown and green eyesn of wander and wonder. Of troublesome torture. Yet, in a land higher than every white and black shade of sharp and fluffy cloud. <br>

		<br> Shackles binding with coarse brown rust, and aged rhetoric. Weakest chain with wilted will.<br> 
		Mundane yellow and peach sounds of life no longer the indicator of this independent's happiness. The Boy was brave. The man must be too.<br>

		<br>Money used to be light green paper. Now its a heavy plastic suit of illusional digital blue, orange and yellow. <br>
		A bad mask hiding the burden of judgement and class through forked tounges of friends. Of society.<br>
		No greek marvel god shining through with powers to save.<br>

		<br>Whistle suddenly shrieking the ears. From the pine, the oak laws of good peoples. <br>
		Life is short echo wary tales from snowy old mountain tops; witnesses to emerald lakes and scerenity stunned rolling lanscapes. <br>
		The busy chattering thieving population dulls no longer loud enough to misguide for at least four star drenched moons. <br>
		Fill the Heart and the heart of others. One and the same. <br>
		Challenge. Achieve. Begin, like the brave boy. <br>
		The road must be tough with scary taniwhas and omens. Only then, gates will open and clock tick time for the highs of the highs.<br>

		<br>Howling wind. Unforgiving loud heavy rain. Battle of dreaded resolve. Slow burning pains. Mountains. Cold. Darkness.<br>
		Forget the narrative. Adventure beckons. Blood & Fire. Pain made white by greens and browns below the bluest halo of the fullest sky. <br>
		Above with the suns hot bright and untouched wink. Personal wink, bright with resolve and achievement. 
		<br><br>

		<h1>Belly Boo</h1>
		<p>	Icey numb appendages
			Cold hoodie failing its task,
			Grey dull and dreary
			frustration with no care to mask
			
			You look confused as I rattle around
			Poo bags and leash, but no treats to be found
			I sense that you know this
			through your loving brown eyes
			so your excited for mischief
			its poorly disguised
			
			'Come on Belly', unknown tone, vary wary
			a tactful ploy, less statement more query
			you hop like a sprinter, then flop on the ground,
			A pitcher bella brown
			winding up on the mound
			
			Shoot your off, leash taming your run
			But your just a little one learning
			the funs just begun
			My patience is short, I snap by the curb
			You sit, look up
			I feel so absurd
			
			So I creep to your pace
			Stop, look listen
			What youve been trying to tell me!
			Life starts to glisten
			
			Strong salt crisp air breezes
			Another strong scent?
			Floppy ears prick, nose raises and twitches
			Another dogs poo? How delightful
			
			Sharp little tug,
			Puppy eyes, Im not being spiteful
			Few feet further a berry
			oung and fallen from brunches
			soon to sooth your teething teeth
			A pop as it crunches
			One skip and two frolicks futher
			Smiling and laughing
			
			You stop with a fervour
			Grumbling growl from a mower
			getting blaring louder
			Too frightened to heath 'it wont run you over'
			Little helping hand and back on our way
			this road isnt long
			but its a huge world of play
			
			A baby white dandelion full and untouched
			the gentlest move and 'puff' off it goes
			Surprised your friend left
			it was only your nose
			
			Its ok though Belly, 
			Plenty friends to be made
			because your beautiful and bold
			sweetheartened caring and brave.
			
			Thank you Belly, loads of love your pals.
