	A growing yearning minimalist take on the world. Tough and Fierce to the Challenge and Thrill of Adventure. Blood & Fire.<br> 
	Learned Inspiration from standing on the shoulders of friendly blue giants. Ego Zero Sum.<br> 
	Sharing brown and green eyesn of wander and wonder. Of troublesome torture. Yet, in a land higher than every white and black shade of sharp and fluffy cloud. <br>

	<br> Shackles binding with coarse brown rust, and aged rhetoric. Weakest chain with wilted will.<br> 
	Mundane yellow and peach sounds of life no longer the indicator of this independent's happiness. The Boy was brave. The man must be too.<br>

	<br>Money used to be light green paper. Now its a heavy plastic suit of illusional digital blue, orange and yellow. <br>
	A bad mask hiding the burden of judgement and class through forked tounges of friends. Of society.<br>
	No greek marvel god shining through with powers to save.<br>

	<br>Whistle suddenly shrieking the ears. From the pine, the oak laws of good peoples. <br>
	Life is short echo wary tales from snowy old mountain tops; witnesses to emerald lakes and scerenity stunned rolling lanscapes. <br>
	The busy chattering thieving population dulls no longer loud enough to misguide for at least four star drenched moons. <br>
	Fill the Heart and the heart of others. One and the same. <br>
	Challenge. Achieve. Begin, like the brave boy. <br>
	The road must be tough with scary taniwhas and omens. Only then, gates will open and clock tick time for the highs of the highs.<br>

	<br>Howling wind. Unforgiving loud heavy rain. Battle of dreaded resolve. Slow burning pains. Mountains. Cold. Darkness.<br>
	Forget the narrative. Adventure beckons. Blood & Fire. Pain made white by greens and browns below the bluest halo of the fullest sky. <br>
	Above with the suns hot bright and untouched wink. Personal wink, bright with resolve and achievement.

<p>
	G.K. Chesterton
“I would maintain that thanks are the highest form of thought; and that gratitude is happiness doubled by wonder.”
Buddhist Proverb
"'Enough' is a feast."
Robert Brault
“Enjoy the little things, for one day you may look back and realize they were the big things.”
Epictetus
“He is a wise man who does not grieve for the things which he has not, but rejoices for those which he has.”
Germany Kent
“It’s a funny thing about life, once you begin to take note of the things you are grateful for, you begin to lose sight of the things that you lack.”
Douglas Wood
“The heart that gives thanks is a happy one, for we cannot feel thankful and unhappy at the same time.”
Dietrich Bonhoeffer
“In ordinary life, we hardly realize that we receive a great deal more than we give, and that it is only with gratitude that life becomes rich.”
Marcel Proust
“Let us be grateful to the people who make us happy; they are the charming gardeners who make our souls blossom.”
